# Welcome
A more complete pipeline to read text in images in the wild. It uses multiple Deep Learning methods and sets the emphasis mostly on the preprocessing of text images to improve the performance of the OCR.

# Goal
Take a look at an example. The images below show the start and the end of the pipeline:

# Text image preprocessing
The emphasis is on the preprocessing of the extracted text images, to increase the performance of the OCR. This process is seperated into 6 stages:
